//  If we're converting video from a GoPro5, do extra to preserve the metadata (gps and sensor data) track
//    GoPro software (e.g. Quik) looks for the the go pro handler names, if not present it will not see the video as it
//    thinks it is from a non-gopro camera. By updating the handler names to what it is expecting, we can trick it into
//  recognising the videos to be GoPro content and editable in Quik. To enable the gauges (gps, sensor data) Quik is even
//    more picky, and must find the 'gpmd' data track inside the video, with a handler name starting with a tab!
//    For consistency, we map all the handler names with a tab as that seems to be what the GoPro itself spits out
//  -tag:d:2 'gpmd' => This is effectively a hack to force ffmpeg to copy the binary 'fdsc' stream, which is present in the
//  original go pro files. Not sure exactly what it is for, but would rather keep it just in case. Unfortunately ffmpeg does Not
//    understand this handler type, so spits out the message: '[mp4 @ 0x7fed5a80cc00] Unknown hldr_type for fdsc, writing dummy values'
//  This effectively just adds a useless dummy stream. Using this hack we instead get the original stream copied, by telling it the
//    the handler_type it should use is actually 'gpmd'. Since we're just copying it as is and not manipulating it this should be fine.
//  Then to be able to distinguish it from the *real* gpmd stream, we change the handler name in the metadata to be GoPro SOS (fdsc stream)
